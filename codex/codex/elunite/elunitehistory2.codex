  "This is my home, my world, where nothing seems to go wrong. Races, specimens of all kinds tend to live here in settings of harmony.,

  In a life where the skies has no limits, and the mountains are so high, I've never though of adventuring these plains.

  They tell us about stories and big adventures they go on, exploring the multi-verse for hidden furtunes and long spoken myth. Something we knew nothing of...",

  "As the days goes, sometimes i believe i've already lived this moment before... i have that feeling i know whats coming tomorrow?

  Feels like i was having tomorrows conversation, repeating moments i haven't reached yet.

  As if my words have lost their meanings.",

  "Maybe tomorrow will be the day i see beyond those's skies when i decide to leave."
