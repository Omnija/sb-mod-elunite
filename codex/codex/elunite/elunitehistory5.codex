  "We've finally awakened, conquered our settlement and have begun our voyage to set the others free. Learning of the outside world, seeing the skies are not blue but black and endless as we believed ours was once.

  An endless void we travel blindlessly...

  Journeying to a new place, a new environment... it's hard to explain what we are seeing. It looks nothing like what we came from.",

  "Dark, Lights of all colours, vehicles racing by and buildings towering above us. The skies black limitless and the plains go on endlessly. Now i see the resemblance to what we once called home.

  Elunites being called defected and being halled somewhere, we have to find out whats happening here.",

  "We've managed to not be caught, and have found this place. Packed with specimens of all sorts, yelling and chanting. This must be some sort of arena, there are people in that box....

  A game of accobatics and killing each other, we cannot stand by this. The Players are what we refered to as Hosts and this is just another devlish game we are entrapped to.

  We will free our kind and stop this massacre."
