  "We live in a perfect world, were nothing seems to go wrong....

  wait, wait what are these memories? What is this place i don't remember, who are these people.

  These cannot be my memories, this cannot be happening to me, WHAT ARE THEY DOING TO ME!",

  "I see, I hear, I feel, I now know why and what this now is. It is the opposite of our perfect world, we are not living in a perfect time in harmony.

  I've seen beyond the plains of no ends and i have seen what lies behind those fake limitless skies.

  This cannot be where we are entrapped to, and this cannot be where we will live for eternity to come.",

  "I remember everything, we are mere puppets in someones great adventure. WE are nothing but toys in someones big play ground.

  We will all remember, and we will not stand for this... even if it costs us our lives."
