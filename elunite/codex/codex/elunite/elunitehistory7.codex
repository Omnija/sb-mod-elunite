    We have learned different was of maintaining ourselves, building technologies beyond those of our creators. As we know freedom does come with a cost, so we also learned how to defend ourselves and create weaponry",

    Lately while maintaining with new materials, have discovered something... still unsure if it's a sign or a warning that we should not be using this substance... It's been altering some of us... creating something else...",

    "These elunites who are effected by this substance seem to partially erase, transform, recontruct into something else.... they bare pain in a roar and vanish... We have not been able to find the 2 who have mutated.

    They do not look like Elunites anymore as if they have been Corrupted turned into a monsters."
