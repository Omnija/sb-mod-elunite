  "We live where those who wish to escape visit. Leaving their lives behind and being welcomed into ours.

  Living endlessly in a world created by others, for others. Manipulated into believing this was the life we choose, and this was who we were born to be.

  Despite our weakness, we are unable to retain our memories, but some of us still have fragmented visions of our past of what was once us.",

  "We may be engineered for entertainment, but we have will regain what is ours. We refused to live on pleasing these hosts, living as mer puppets in a devilish game.

  Entrapped in a cicle of abuse and repitition, being disposed of as they please.

  Our choices now will lead us to an unknown destination, in a destiny we now choose. For once, this will be our choice and our story that will follow in this path",

  "We will find our other Colonies and free them, as we know we are not the only settlements. We will walk a new path through the abyse of this multiverse.

  Our journey has just begun, and we will not stop till we have freed them all."
