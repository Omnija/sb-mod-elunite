  "In a multiverse where races are extincted and generations of history become forgotten. Some where, someone remembers and wants to share their visions of that story.

  Lost scrolls, scriptures, books,  and hidden myths tell stories.. but not one like ours..",

  "In a place where a stone can become comets, and ribble of water becomes a tsunami, tradition becomes lost and memories become forgotten.

  We are created for this perfect story, we were assigned to play the perfect role... we are the envisions of what was lost.",

  "I am an Inventor, a Visionist, I cannot accept this multiverse to disipate it's History...

  I cannot allow this to happen.

  Awake my children as their time has past, but yours has just begun, come play in their stories...",

  "Some where, someone wants to share their Tall Tales and we are a pawns in this story."
